# Git Guide

This repository contains practical examples and tutorials to help you learn Git, the widely-used distributed version control system.

---

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes to files and helps multiple people collaborate on a project. Developers worldwide use Git to manage code efficiently, enabling:

- **Version Control**
- **Collaboration**
- **Backup**

---

## Why Use Git?

- **Version Control**: Track changes to project files and easily roll back to previous versions.  
- **Collaboration**: Work with multiple developers on the same project without overwriting each other's changes.  
- **Backup**: Push code to remote platforms like GitHub to keep a safe copy accessible from anywhere.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installing Git

#### Windows
1. Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win).  
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts.  
3. After installation, use **Git Bash** (recommended) or the command line.

### 2. Configuring Git
After installing Git, configure it with your name and email (these will appear in your commits):
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --list
```

You can check your Git configuration at any time by running:
```
git config --list
```

## Basic Git Workflow 
Hereâ€™s an overview of the basic Git commands you'll use in your workflow:

### 1. Initialize a Git Repository
To create a new Git repository, navigate to your project folder and run:

```git init```
This creates a .git folder where Git will track changes.

### 2. Cloning an Existing Repository
To get a copy of an existing repository, use:

```git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git```

This will download the repository and all its files to your local machine.

### 3. Staging and Committing Changes
Adding Files to the Staging Area:
Once you've made changes to your files, you need to stage them before committing:
```
git add <filename>  # Add a specific file
git add .           # Add all changes in the current directory
```

Committing Changes:
Once staged, commit the changes with a message describing what you did:
```git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"```

## Defining Multiple Authors for a Commit

Each commit in Git has a default author, which is the person who made the changes to the code.

However, when working in teams, some code may be written collaboratively by a pair or a group. So how do we define the co-authorship for these additional contributors in a commit?

Git provides the ability to add multiple authors to a commit. To do this, after writing the commit message, skip two lines and use the keyword `Co-authored-by:`, followed by the name and the email associated with GitHub (within `< >`) of each co-author.

Each co-author should be on a separate line, as shown in the example below:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add new functionality.
>
>
Co-authored-by: NAME <name@email.com>
Co-authored-by: OTHER-NAME <other@email.com>"
```
### 4. Checking the Status
You can check the status of your repository to see which files have changed and which are staged for commit:
```git status```

### 5. Viewing Commit History
To see the commit history of your project, run:
```git log```

## Branching and Merging
### 1. Creating a Branch
A branch allows you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously. To create a new branch:
```git branch my-new-branch```

### 2. Switching Branches
To switch to a different branch:
```git checkout my-new-branch```

### 3. Merging Branches
Once your work is complete on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch:

Switch to the main branch:
```git checkout main```

Merge your feature branch:
```git merge my-new-branch```

## Working with Remotes
Git allows you to work with remote repositories (like those on GitHub). Here are some important commands:

### 1. Adding a Remote Repository
To link your local project with a remote repository, add a remote URL:

```git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git```

### 2. Pushing Changes to Remote
After committing changes, you can upload them to your remote repository (GitHub):
```git push origin main  # Push to the 'main' branch ```

### 3. Pulling Changes from Remote
To download the latest changes from the remote repository:

```git pull origin main```

| `git pull origin <branch>`   | Pulls the latest changes from the remote repository|

## Ignoring Files with .gitignore

Teach Git which files and/or directories in your project should be automatically ignored in version control by creating a hidden file called ```.gitignore```.
The ```.gitignore``` is a simple text file that tells Git which files and folders to exclude from version control, keeping your repository clean, organized, and secure.

### Quick Guide to Create a .gitignore in VS Code:
Open the Project Folder: Launch VS Code and navigate to your project's root folder.
Create the ```.gitignore``` File: Go to "File" > "New File", name it .gitignore, and press Enter.
Add Ignore Patterns: List the files or folders to ignore, one per line. For example:
node_modules/: Ignore Node.js modules.
